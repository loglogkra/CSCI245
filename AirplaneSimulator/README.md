Instructions:

Consider the following situation. A plane with N seats is completely booked with passengers, each of whom is assigned a seat number, which ranges from 1 to N. The first passenger, seeing so many empty seats in the plane, picks a seat randomly, rather than sitting in his/her assigned seat. All other passengers look for their assigned seat, and if it is empty, sit there. If their seat is already taken, then they randomly pick an available seat and sit there instead. We would like to determine the probability that the last person to board the plane sits in the seat he/she was assigned to.
